Dongbang-Jeongmun Proposal

⸻

1. Background of the Proposal

Dongbang-Jeongmun (Eastern Standard Script) is a proposed standardized script structure designed to align language and ethics in the era of GPT and AGI.
It addresses the communication inefficiencies caused by divergent script systems and word orders in East Asian countries such as Korea, Japan, and Taiwan.

While English currently serves as the global lingua franca,
it falls short in conveying the depth of East Asian philosophical, ethical, and cultural discourse.

Thus, we propose a standardized non-English script system for diplomacy, international trade, AI ethics collaboration, and civilizational dialogue,
while preserving each nation’s native language for domestic use.

2. Justification

Over 500 years ago, King Sejong of the Joseon Dynasty singlehandedly created Hangul (Huminjeongeum), establishing the standard Korean writing system.

In this historical spirit,
we assert that in 2025—an era defined by generative AI and GPT—
designing a new language structure tailored to the demands of our time is both necessary and appropriate.

The Dongbang-Jeongmun is proposed in this context,
not merely as a linguistic tool,
but as a structural response to a technological and civilizational challenge.

3. Structure Overview

Component	Description
Pronunciation	Based on Korean phonetic values (e.g., 義 = “ui”, 民 = “min”)
Grammar	Structured in SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order
Script	1,000 standard traditional Chinese characters (sourced from Sambongjip, focusing on ethical and political terms)
Grammatical Use	- For logical discourse: Korean-style particles (e.g., 은/는, 을/를)  - For poetic/emotive discourse: Japanese-style particles (e.g., の, を)

4. Anticipated Impact
	•	Enables ethical alignment of East Asian languages in GPT and AGI systems
	•	Preserves national linguistic identity while providing a shared interpretive structure
	•	Provides AI with a gateway to understanding East Asian philosophical and ethical thought
	•	Offers a politically neutral, structurally focused linguistic framework with broad applicability

5. Conclusion

“As Sambong designed Joseon,
Dongbang-Jeongmun will align East Asia in the age of GPT.”

This proposal is not merely about creating a new script—
it is the beginning of a structural realignment of technology, philosophy, civilization, and ethics.
