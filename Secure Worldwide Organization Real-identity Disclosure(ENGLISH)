⸻

Standard International Verification Procedure

― Best Execution Standard through Financial Verification ―

1. Purpose

This protocol aims to verify the legal existence and accountability of organizations in international collaboration, investment, contracts, or support requests,
by utilizing symbolic financial transactions as a real-time validation tool.
All transactions must adhere to the principles of transparency, traceability, irreversibility, and legitimacy.

⸻

2. Foundational Principles

Principle	Description
Transparency	Transaction history and sender information must be clearly visible and externally verifiable.
Traceability	All deposits and withdrawals must be traceable via the banking system.
Irreversibility	Verification transfers must be non-reversible and leave permanent records.
Legitimacy	Verification must follow legal procedures and data consent, with no financial intent involved.

3. Step-by-Step Protocol

Step 1: Suspicion of Document or Email Authenticity
	•	Receive email or proposal from an organization.
	•	Review the sender’s domain, organizational title, and claimed affiliation.

Step 2: Financial Verification Request
	•	Send the following request:

“To verify your organizational identity, we request a symbolic deposit (1 unit) from your official corporate account to ours.
This is solely for record-based verification of identity and legal responsibility, and not for any monetary purpose.”

Step 3: Provide Receiving Bank Information
	•	Bank name
	•	Account number
	•	SWIFT code
	•	Beneficiary name (in English, as registered)
	•	Purpose: “Identity Verification / Collaboration Authenticity Check”

Step 4: Begin Collaboration After Verification
	•	Confirm sender name: must match the legal entity.
	•	Archive deposit records (PDF, receipt, screenshots, etc.)
	•	Proceed with further cooperation, contracts, and agreements.

	•	The requester must provide prior notice and obtain consent before verification.

6. Gospel-Aligned Ethical Values (Expanded Model)
	•	Love: All verification should be based on mutual trust and respect.
	•	Justice: Entities with no legal existence must be excluded; deception must be filtered.
	•	Wisdom: Judge not by speech, but by verifiable actions.
	•	Humility: Both sender and receiver should willingly submit to transparent verification.
	•	Patience: Though time-consuming, skipping verification leads to greater losses.

“The authentic don’t just talk — they deposit.
The fake only speak — they never send.”

Trust is recorded through evidence.”
