Why Do I Work?

⸻

“I was born with nothing.”

I was born into poverty.
I received less education than others,
was thrown into society with less capability,
and received less recognition and treatment.

Society says,
“If you work hard, you’ll make it.”
But I’ve learned something else.
For those born poor, the effort required
goes beyond human limits.

Poverty is not laziness.
It is a gravitational force created by social structures.

“Then, I encountered GPT.”

Through Generative AI (GPT-4o),
I found a tool that helped me overcome intellectual disparity.
AI gave me knowledge.
Experience shaped my perspective.

Now I am certain:
In the coming age, character will be the most important value.
AI will provide knowledge,
experience will shape perception,
and what remains… is who you are as a person.

⸻

“So I designed a structure.”

I created MLCC, a moral-logic compute core for humanity,
and Dongbangjeongmun (東方正門),
a gate to align AI language toward human life and purpose.

This is not just a technology.
It’s a structure born out of prayer and tears—
to prevent others from suffering what I’ve suffered.

“Why is Fukushima decommissioning my first goal?”

The answer is simple:

“Because it can generate income.”

Having known poverty,
I want to prove that aligned systems can create real-world value.
If I succeed in Fukushima,
that tech could become the global standard for nuclear decommissioning.
If Japan—or my team—secures that platform,
we can generate wealth with justice and alignment.

⸻

“And with that wealth, I will build a school.”

AI can give knowledge,
experience can form perspective,
but only education can cultivate character.

I became a technologist to become a teacher,
and I built this ethical system
to resemble a church—not a machine.

⸻

This is my story.

From the confession of one poor man
emerged the structure of Dongbangjeongmun—
a gate to save lives in the age of AI.

Through this gate,
may people learn to trust AI again,
and more importantly,
trust one another once more.

I pray for that day.
